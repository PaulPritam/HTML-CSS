                    Experts are debating on this topic for years. Also, the technology covered a long way to make human
                    life easier but the negative aspect of it canâ€™t be ignored. Over the years technological advancement
                    has caused a severe rise in pollution. Also, pollution has become a major cause of many health
                    issues. Besides, it has cut off people from society rather than connecting them. Above all, it has
                    taken away many jobs from the workers class.

                    that, the research conducted in laboratories contributes a lot to the development of technologies.
